By default, a column can hold NULL values. If you do not want a column to have a NULL value, use the NOT NULL constraint.

It restricts a column from having a NULL value.
We use ALTER statement and MODIFY statement to specify this constraint.
One important point to note about this constraint is that it cannot be defined at table level.

It ensures that a column will only have unique values. A UNIQUE constraint field cannot have any duplicate data.

It prevents two records from having identical values in a column
We use ALTER statement and MODIFY statement to specify this constraint.
